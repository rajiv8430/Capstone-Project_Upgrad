                        *Credit Card Fraud Detection*
A credit card is one of the most used financial products to make online purchases and
payments. Though the Credit cards can be a convenient way to manage your finances, they can
also be risky. Credit card fraud is the unauthorized use of someone else&#39;s credit card or credit
card information to make purchases or withdraw cash.
It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card
transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European
cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492
frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds)
account for 0.172% of all transactions.
We have to build a classification model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
